I have solved 700+ coding question in c++ in various platform like interviewbit, leetcode, geeksforgeek and codechef.

-> advantage of design pattern
1. consistency
    - decrease the error
    
    - increase the detecting errors
    
    - cost saving
2. completeness : how much this code meet its requirement?

3. correctness : correct result

4. less coupling : opposite if cohesive

5. more cohesive  : soft elements must be independent or degree of independence
